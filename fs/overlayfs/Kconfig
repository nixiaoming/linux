config OVERLAY_FS
	tristate "Overlay filesystem support"
	select EXPORTFS
	help
	  An overlay filesystem combines two filesystems - an 'upper' filesystem
	  and a 'lower' filesystem.  When a name exists in both filesystems, the
	  object in the 'upper' filesystem is visible while the object in the
	  'lower' filesystem is either hidden or, in the case of directories,
	  merged with the 'upper' object.

	  For more information see Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt

config OVERLAY_FS_REDIRECT_DIR
	bool "Overlayfs: turn on redirect dir feature by default"
	depends on OVERLAY_FS
	help
	  If this config option is enabled then overlay filesystems will use
	  redirects when renaming directories by default.  In this case it is
	  still possible to turn off redirects globally with the
	  "redirect_dir=off" module option or on a filesystem instance basis
	  with the "redirect_dir=off" mount option.

	  Note, that redirects are not backward compatible.  That is, mounting
	  an overlay which has redirects on a kernel that doesn't support this
	  feature will have unexpected results.

config OVERLAY_FS_INDEX
	bool "Overlayfs: turn on inodes index feature by default"
	depends on OVERLAY_FS
	help
	  If this config option is enabled then overlay filesystems will use
	  the inodes index dir to map lower inodes to upper inodes by default.
	  In this case it is still possible to turn off index globally with the
	  "index=off" module option or on a filesystem instance basis with the
	  "index=off" mount option.

	  The inodes index feature prevents breaking of lower hardlinks on copy
	  up.

config OVERLAY_FS_INDEX_INCOMPAT
	bool "Overlayfs: support incompatible index feature"
	depends on OVERLAY_FS_INDEX
	help
	  If this config option is enabled then inodes index is declared an
	  incompatible feature and kernel will refuse to mount an overlay with
	  inodes index off when a non-empty index directory exists.

	  After mounting an overlay filesystems once with incompatible index
	  enabled, mounting the overlay with a kernel that doesn't support
	  inodes index feature or mounting with inodes index off will either
	  fail to mount or fallback to read-only mount.

	  The inodes index dir resides under the 'workdir' path provided with
	  overlay mount options, so it is still possible to mount the overlay
	  on a kernel that doesn't support incompatible index feature, by
	  cleaning the content of 'workdir' or by providing an alternative
	  'workdir' path.  In that case, mounting the same overlay again with
	  inodes index enabled will have unexpected results.

config OVERLAY_FS_SNAPSHOT
	bool "Overlayfs snapshot support (Experimental)"
	depends on OVERLAY_FS

	help
	  This enables experimental support for overlayfs snapshot.
	  If unsure, say N
